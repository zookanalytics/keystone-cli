# Keystone CLI Roadmap

This roadmap focuses on additions beyond current README features (structured outputs, dry-run, concurrency limits, MCP server, TUI dashboard, retries/timeouts, etc.). Priorities are ordered by user value, risk reduction, and leverage across the platform.

## Cross-cutting considerations

### Dependencies and sequencing
Goal: Keep ordering explicit when later work depends on earlier contracts or APIs.
Notes:
1. Typed schemas and input enums should land before blueprint enforcement and sub-workflow output contracts.
2. Idempotency and allowFailure should precede triggers and engine handoffs to keep retries safe.
3. Plugin API should precede curated plugin registry and remote blueprints for compatibility guarantees.
4. LLM caching should land before cached-token telemetry and evaluation reports that depend on it.

### Security and trust defaults
Goal: Add guardrails for features that run external code or fetch remote content.
Notes:
1. Engine steps and triggers should require explicit allowlists and clear prompt-based consent.
2. Remote registries, plugins, and blueprints should support signature or checksum verification.
3. DevMode and compile should emit a manifest of embedded assets and permissions.
4. Default to sandboxed execution unless the workflow opts into `allowInsecure`.

### P0 acceptance criteria
Goal: Define completion gates for foundation features.
Notes:
1. Typed schemas: validation errors include path/line, `keystone validate --strict` updated, tests added.
2. Idempotency: dedup is persisted and observable in logs, resume-safe, tests cover collisions.
3. Structured repair: re-ask path is logged, failures surfaced with schema diff, tests added.
4. Error messages: snippet + suggestion shown for YAML/expression failures, docs updated.
5. Global errors: recovery runs only after retries/auto_heal and before `finally`, run stays failed, `last_failed_step` exposed, tests added.
6. AllowFailure: exit status captured, workflow continues, interaction with retries defined.
7. Input enums/secrets: enum validation enforced, redaction verified in logs/UI, secrets redacted at rest by default.
8. Interrupt support: SIGINT cancels cleanly, run marked canceled, no DB corruption.

### P1 acceptance criteria
Goal: Define completion gates for developer experience and orchestration upgrades.
Notes:
1. Durable timers resume across restarts; scheduler tested with long sleeps/human waits.
2. Subflows have enforced output contracts; compensation paths are documented and exercised in examples.
3. Backpressure pools expose queue depth and utilization; defaults are configurable and validated.
4. Engine steps stream logs, return summaries, and are gated by allowlists and idempotency.
5. Blueprint enforcement includes schema validation and is consumed across plan/generate steps.
6. XDG paths are supported with a migration helper and clear precedence rules.
7. VS Code schema support, remote blueprints, testing, debug bundles, and caching ship with docs and smoke tests.

### P2 acceptance criteria
Goal: Define completion gates for observability, ecosystem, and scale.
Notes:
1. Routing/failover is policy-driven, logged, and tested under simulated outages.
2. Evaluation framework supports datasets, metrics, and baseline comparison reports.
3. OTel/Prom exports are configurable and verified against a reference stack.
4. TUI topology view renders live DAGs with stable performance on large runs.
5. Retention/archival/replay provide deterministic replay with pinned versions.
6. Plugin API is versioned with compatibility checks and at least one reference plugin.
7. Import/export and triggers are usable end-to-end with security guidance.
8. Embedded binaries and remote runners have a documented workflow and a working demo.

## P0 - Foundation reliability (next 1-2 releases)

### Typed step input/output schemas with runtime validation
Goal: Provide strong guarantees about step inputs and outputs so failures are caught early and surfaced with precise context. This should cover all step types, not just LLM steps, and integrate with expression evaluation.
Tasks:
1. [x] Extend workflow schema to allow optional `inputSchema` and `outputSchema` per step (JSON Schema only).
2. [x] Validate step inputs at scheduling time and outputs at completion time with path-level error details.
3. [x] `keystone validate --strict` updated.
4. [x] Propagate typed outputs into the expression engine.
5. [x] Document examples and migration guidance for existing workflows.

### Idempotency keys and automatic deduplication
Goal: Make retries safe for side-effecting steps (HTTP, shell, file, LLM) and for resume scenarios by reusing prior outputs when a unique key matches.
Tasks:
1. [x] Add optional `idempotencyKey` on steps and a per-run dedup scope with TTL (default scope: run).
2. [x] Persist idempotency records in the DB with status, outputs, and hashes.
3. [x] Implement de-dup behavior for retries/resume, including "in-flight" detection.
4. [x] Add CLI controls for clearing dedup entries and toggling behavior.

### Structured output validation with auto retry/repair
Goal: Close the loop on LLM structured outputs by automatically re-asking or repairing when schema validation fails.
Tasks:
1. [x] Add per-step config for `outputRetries` and `repairStrategy` (re-ask, repair-only, or hybrid) when `outputSchema` validation fails.
2. [x] Implement automatic re-ask with validation error context and a compact repair prompt.
3. [x] Record repair attempts and final validation failures in logs and run metadata.
4. [x] Document recommended schemas and best practices for stable output.

### Better error messages with context and suggested fixes
Goal: Make workflow failures actionable by adding context (line, expression, step inputs) and likely fixes for common issues.
Tasks:
1. [x] Build an error renderer for YAML and expression errors with line/column and source snippets.
2. [x] Add suggestions for common cases (unknown step id, missing inputs, schema mismatch).
3. [x] Attach resolved inputs, attempt count, and step metadata to failure logs.
4. [x] Add a `--explain` mode to print expanded diagnostics.

### Global `errors` block for workflow-level recovery
Goal: Provide a top-level recovery path that runs when a step exhausts retries, enabling overseer-style analysis.
Tasks:
1. [x] Add `errors` blocks to the workflow schema with access to `last_failed_step`.
2. [x] Ensure `errors` steps run after retries/auto_heal are exhausted and before `finally`.
3. [x] Add output contracts so recovery steps can annotate the run summary without flipping status.
4. [x] Document patterns for agentic self-reflection and escalation.

### Task-level `allowFailure` for fail-forward steps
Goal: Allow steps to fail without stopping the workflow, while preserving error context for downstream logic.
Tasks:
1. [x] Add `allowFailure: boolean` to step schema and execution logic.
2. [x] Record exit status and error output while marking the step `success`.
3. [x] Ensure `allowFailure` interacts cleanly with `retry`, `auto_heal`, and `errors` blocks.
4. [x] Document patterns for agentic exploration steps.

### Input enums and secret-typed inputs
Goal: Strengthen guardrails by restricting input values and pre-declaring redaction.
Tasks:
1. [x] Extend `InputSchema` with `values` (enum) and `secret` flags.
2. [x] Enforce enum validation at parse time and in `keystone validate` (runtime validation now enforced).
3. [x] Integrate `secret` inputs with the redactor for logs/UI and redact at rest by default (config toggle).
4. [x] Add examples and migration notes.

### Interrupt support and safe cancellation (AbortSignal)
Goal: Allow users to stop large parallel loops without corrupting the SQLite state and mark runs as canceled cleanly.
Tasks:
1. [x] Add AbortController/Signal to `WorkflowRunner` and step executors.
2. [x] Handle SIGINT/SIGTERM to request cancellation and persist run state.
3. [x] Ensure foreach cancellation drains in-flight steps and blocks new scheduling.
4. [x] Add tests for cancellation, resume, and idempotency interactions.

## P1 - Developer experience and safe orchestration (next 2-4 releases)

### [x] Durable timers for long-running workflows
Goal: Allow sleeps and human waits to persist across restarts and pause for hours or days without losing state.
Tasks:
1. [x] Persist sleep and human wait states with wake-up timestamps in the DB.
2. [x] Add a lightweight scheduler to resume runs at the right time.
3. [x] Ensure timeouts and retries are consistent across restarts.
4. [x] Document semantics and edge cases (clock skew, daylight changes).

### [x] Dynamic subflows with fan-out/fan-in and compensations
Goal: Support complex orchestration patterns with safe rollbacks for side effects.
Notes:
1. Fan-out branches should be addressable for join conditions (all/any/quorum/count) with timeouts and partial results.
2. Compensations should run in reverse completion order within a scope (step, subflow, workflow) and be idempotent.
3. Rollbacks should be triggered on error, cancel, or explicit `rollback` while preserving original failure context.
Tasks:
1. [x] Add a fan-out/fan-in join step with explicit join conditions, timeouts, and partial-result behavior.
2. [x] Introduce `compensate` blocks for steps, sub-workflows, and top-level workflows.

4. [x] Persist compensation queues/state in the DB for resume-safe execution.
5. [x] Expose join/compensation status in logs and run metadata.
6. [x] Ship example workflows that demonstrate fan-out/fan-in and compensation patterns.

### [x] Sub-workflow output contracts and mapping
Goal: Make sub-workflow outputs predictable, namespaced, and easy to consume.
Notes:
1. Output contracts should be declared at the sub-workflow level and be versionable.

Tasks:
1. [x] Add a workflow-level output contract schema and validation on subflow completion.
2. [x] Namespace sub-workflow outputs under `steps.<id>.outputs.outputs` with optional alias mapping.
3. [x] Support output mapping (select/rename/defaults) on `type: workflow` steps.
4. [x] Add validation for missing outputs and type mismatches with path-level errors.
5. [x] Document patterns for contract-first subflows and migration guidance.

### [x] Concurrency limits and backpressure management
Goal: Avoid overload by introducing global and per-resource concurrency pools with fair scheduling.
Notes:
1. Pools should be global by default with per-workflow overrides.
2. Queueing should be fair and cancel-aware to avoid starvation.
3. Backpressure should interact cleanly with timeouts and retries.

4. [x] Add config for defaults and per-workflow overrides, including caps per run.
5. [x] Add tests for fairness, starvation prevention, and timeout interactions.

### Engine step for external autonomous tools

Notes:
1. Engines should be allowlisted and version-pinned; env and cwd must be explicit.
2. Structured summaries should be schema-validated to enable safe chaining.
3. Engine steps should respect idempotency, redaction, and timeouts.
4. Example template lives at `src/templates/engine-example.yaml`.
Tasks:
1. [x] Add `engine` step type and schema (command, args, input, env, timeout, cwd, outputSchema).
2. [x] Define an engine allowlist with pinned versions and enforce it at runtime.
3. [x] Implement an executor that spawns the external CLI, streams logs, and captures stdout/stderr and exit status.
4. [x] Parse a structured summary (JSON/YAML or file output), validate it, and store it as an artifact.
5. [x] Add optional `handoff` support so `llm` steps can delegate to an engine with structured inputs.
6. [x] Add safety controls (allowlists/denylists, idempotencyKey, redaction) with defaults.
7. [x] Provide examples and docs for engine handoffs and summaries.

### [x] Blueprint -> Plan -> Engineer workflow specialization
Goal: Produce a system blueprint artifact before planning and generation to ensure consistency across parallel work.
Notes:
