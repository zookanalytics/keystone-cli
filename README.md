```

**Bash:**
```bash
source <(keystone completion bash)
```

---

## 🚦 Quick Start

### 1. Initialize a Project
```bash
keystone init
```
This creates the `.keystone/` directory for configuration and seeds `.keystone/workflows/` with default automation files and agents (like `scaffold-feature` and `keystone-architect`).

### 2. Configure your Environment
Add your API keys to the generated `.env` file:
```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
```
Alternatively, you can use the built-in authentication management:
```bash
keystone auth login openai
keystone auth login anthropic
```

### 3. Run a Workflow
```bash
keystone run basic-shell
```
Keystone automatically looks in `.keystone/workflows/` (locally and in your home directory) for `.yaml` or `.yml` files.

### 4. Monitor with the Dashboard
```bash
keystone ui
```

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

Keystone uses a local configuration file at `.keystone/config.yaml` to manage model providers and model mappings.

```yaml
default_provider: openai

providers:
  openai:
    type: openai
    base_url: https://api.openai.com/v1
    api_key_env: OPENAI_API_KEY
    default_model: gpt-4o
  anthropic:
    type: anthropic
    base_url: https://api.anthropic.com/v1
    api_key_env: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
    default_model: claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620
  groq:
    type: openai
    base_url: https://api.groq.com/openai/v1
    api_key_env: GROQ_API_KEY
    default_model: llama-3.3-70b-versatile

model_mappings:
  "gpt-*": openai
  "claude-*": anthropic
  "o1-*": openai
  "llama-*": groq

mcp_servers:
  filesystem:
    command: npx
    args: ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/path/to/allowed/directory"]
  github:
    command: npx
    args: ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"]
      env:
        GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN: "your-github-pat" # Or omit if GITHUB_TOKEN is in your .env

storage:

  retention_days: 30
```

### Model & Provider Resolution

Keystone resolves which provider to use for a model in the following order:

1. **Explicit Provider:** Use the `provider` field in an agent or step definition.
2. **Provider Prefix:** Use the `provider:model` syntax (e.g., `model: copilot:gpt-4o`).
3. **Model Mappings:** Matches the model name against the `model_mappings` in your config (supports suffix `*` for prefix matching).
4. **Default Provider:** Falls back to the `default_provider` defined in your config.

#### Example: Explicit Provider in Agent
**`.keystone/workflows/agents/summarizer.md`**
```markdown
---
name: summarizer
provider: anthropic
model: claude-3-5-sonnet-latest
---
```

#### Example: Provider Prefix in Step
```yaml
- id: notify
  type: llm
  agent: summarizer
  model: copilot:gpt-4o
  prompt: ...
```

### OpenAI Compatible Providers
You can add any OpenAI-compatible provider (Groq, Together AI, Perplexity, Local Ollama, etc.) by setting the `type` to `openai` and providing the `base_url` and `api_key_env`.

### GitHub Copilot Support

Keystone supports using your GitHub Copilot subscription directly. To authenticate (using the GitHub Device Flow):

```bash
keystone auth login github
```

Then, you can use Copilot in your configuration:

```yaml
providers:
  copilot:
    type: copilot
    default_model: gpt-4o
```

Authentication tokens for Copilot are managed automatically after the initial login. 

### API Key Management

For other providers, you can either store API keys in a `.env` file in your project root:
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`

Or use the `keystone auth login` command to securely store them in your local machine's configuration:
- `keystone auth login openai`
- `keystone auth login anthropic`

## 📝 Workflow Example

Workflows are defined in YAML. Dependencies are automatically resolved based on the `needs` field, and **Keystone also automatically detects implicit dependencies** from your `${{ }}` expressions.

```yaml
name: build-and-notify
description: Build the project and notify the team

inputs:
  branch:
    type: string
    default: main

steps:
  - id: checkout
    type: shell
    run: git checkout ${{ inputs.branch }}

  - id: install
    type: shell
    # Implicit dependency on 'checkout' detected from expression below
    if: ${{ steps.checkout.status == 'success' }}
    run: bun install

  - id: build
    type: shell
    needs: [install] # Explicit dependency
    run: bun run build
    retry:
      count: 3
      backoff: exponential

  - id: notify
    type: llm
    # Implicit dependency on 'build' detected from expression below
    agent: summarizer
    prompt: |
      The build for branch "${{ inputs.branch }}" was successful.
      Result: ${{ steps.build.output }}
      Please write a concise 1-sentence summary for Slack.

outputs:
  slack_message: ${{ steps.notify.output }}
```

## 🏗️ Step Types

Keystone supports several specialized step types:

- `shell`: Run arbitrary shell commands.
- `llm`: Prompt an agent and get structured or unstructured responses. Supports `schema` (JSON Schema) for structured output.
- `request`: Make HTTP requests (GET, POST, etc.).
- `file`: Read, write, or append to files.
- `human`: Pause execution for manual confirmation or text input.
  - `inputType: confirm`: Simple Enter-to-continue prompt.
  - `inputType: text`: Prompt for a string input, available via `${{ steps.id.output }}`.
- `workflow`: Trigger another workflow as a sub-step.
- `sleep`: Pause execution for a specified duration.

All steps support common features like `needs` (dependencies), `if` (conditionals), `retry`, `timeout`, `foreach` (parallel iteration), and `transform` (post-process output using expressions).

#### Example: Transform & Foreach Concurrency
```yaml
- id: list_files
  type: shell
  run: ls *.txt
  # Post-process stdout into an array of filenames
  transform: ${{ stdout.trim().split('\n') }}

- id: process_files
  type: shell
  foreach: ${{ steps.list_files.output }}
  concurrency: 5 # Process 5 files at a time
  run: echo "Processing ${{ item }}"
```

## 🤖 Agent Definitions

Agents are defined in Markdown files with YAML frontmatter, making them easy to read and version control.

**`.keystone/workflows/agents/summarizer.md`**
```markdown
---
name: summarizer
provider: openai
model: gpt-4o
description: Summarizes technical logs into human-readable messages
---

You are a technical communications expert. Your goal is to take technical output 
(like build logs or test results) and provide a concise, professional summary.
```

### Agent Tools

Agents can be equipped with tools, which are essentially workflow steps they can choose to execute. You can define tools in the agent definition, or directly in an LLM step within a workflow.

**`.keystone/workflows/agents/developer.md`**
```markdown
---
name: developer
tools:
  - name: list_files
    description: List files in the current directory
    execution:
      id: list-files-tool
      type: shell
      run: ls -F
---
You are a software developer. You can use tools to explore the codebase.
```

### Keystone as an MCP Server

Keystone can itself act as an MCP server, allowing other agents (like Claude Desktop or GitHub Copilot) to discover and run your workflows as tools.

```bash
keystone mcp
```

> **Note:** Workflow execution via the Keystone MCP server is synchronous. This provides a better experience for agents as they receive the final results directly, though it means the connection remains open for the duration of the workflow run.

#### Global MCP Servers
Define shared MCP servers in `.keystone/config.yaml` to reuse them across different workflows. Keystone ensures that multiple steps using the same global server will share a single running process.

Keystone supports both local (stdio) and remote (SSE) MCP servers.

```yaml
mcp_servers:
  # Local server (stdio)
  filesystem:
    type: local # Default
    command: npx
    args: ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/path/to/allowed/directory"]

  # Remote server (SSE)
  atlassian:
    type: remote
    url: https://mcp.atlassian.com/v1/sse
```

#### Using MCP in Steps
You can use global servers, define local ones, or include all global servers at once.

```yaml
- id: analyze_code
  type: llm
  agent: developer
  # Option 1: Explicitly include global servers by name
  # Option 2: Define a local one-off server (standard object syntax)
  mcpServers:
    - filesystem 
    - name: custom-tool
      command: node
      args: ["./scripts/custom-mcp.js"]
  
  # Option 3: Automatically include ALL global servers
  useGlobalMcp: true 
  
  prompt: "Analyze the architecture of this project."
```

In these examples, the agent will have access to all tools provided by the MCP servers (like `list_directory`, `read_file`, etc.) in addition to any tools defined in the agent or the step itself.
